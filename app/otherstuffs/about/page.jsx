            A curious mind in the world of code, and a tender heart in the world
            of verse — I’m <span className="font-semibold">Smriti Jha</span>, a{" "}
            <span className="text-blue-700 font-medium">Software Engineer</span>{" "}

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            With one hand in logic and the other in lyricism, I walk the line
            between technology and creativity — building with precision and
            expressing with passion.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This space is my canvas. Here you’ll find thoughtful projects,
            heartfelt poems, and glimpses of a journey that honors both
            structure and spontaneity.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            With a foundation in computer science and a soul deeply connected to
            expression, I walk the fine line between structure and spontaneity.
            Writing code teaches me discipline, precision, and problem-solving —
            while poetry grants me freedom, reflection, and emotional clarity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            I started writing poetry as a reflection of someone else's affection
            — what began as an echo of their presence slowly became a voice of
            my own. Over time, that affection turned into inspiration, and the
            words that once belonged to someone else became the way I found
            myself.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            My journey began with curiosity — about how machines think and how
            hearts feel. Today, that curiosity drives every project I build and
            every poem I pen. From crafting user experiences that feel intuitive
            and meaningful to capturing fleeting moments in carefully chosen
            words, I strive to create with both purpose and passion.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Beyond the screen and the page, I’m someone who believes in
            continuous growth, meaningful connections, and the magic of little
            things. Whether it’s a line of JavaScript or a line from a poem, my
            goal is the same: to make someone pause, reflect, and feel.
          </p>

          <p className="italic text-gray-600 mt-6 text-lg">
            “Let technology build the future — and poetry remind us why it's
            worth building.”
